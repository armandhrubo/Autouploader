# Autouploader

A simple Google Drive uploader I created to aid in uploading plenty of files on to my Drive folder. It's very small and nifty and saves a lot of time. As of now, there is no GUI.
I plan on evolving this with a proper GUI and more functionalities, once I have more free time. In the meantime, do enjoy this mock-up version.
